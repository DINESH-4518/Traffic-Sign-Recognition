Traffic Sign Recognition System
Description
This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition System using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to recognize and classify traffic signs from images, which can be useful for autonomous driving applications and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation components.

Features
Traffic Sign Classification: Detect and classify traffic signs from images using a trained machine learning model.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data augmentation and normalization to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train and evaluate models using a dataset of traffic sign images.
Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing model predictions and performance metrics.
